## Project Description

# Smart Rotary Actuator for Robotics Research and Applications

## This is the main project of the **Robot Design Studio** course I took at Northwestern University from January to June 2018.
#### As a team of 7, our goal is to design, research, test and produce a rotary actuator that can accomplish **absolute position control**, **speed control**, and **force control**, with a rated torque of 2 Nm.
#### I am personally fully responsible for all the **CAD, engineering drawing, prototype 3D printing, and assembly**. Please refer to our team documentation listed below for more information.


#### Please use Google Docs to open the files below otherwise there will be some format issues.
